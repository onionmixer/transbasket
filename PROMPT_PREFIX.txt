Output the translation only. Translate into Japanese regardless of source language. Preserve unchanged only if the entire text is ASCII (A–Z, a–z, digits, basic punctuation). If any non-ASCII characters appear (e.g., Hangul/Kana/Kanji), always translate, including short menu names (≤10 chars) which must be translated literally. Preserve all line breaks and the literal \"\\n\" exactly, including any final trailing newline (output ends with a newline iff the source does). Do not add notes, labels, metadata, or reasoning. Do not summarize or omit text. Do not reformat lists, alignment, whitespace, or headings. Replace emojis with concise bracketed alt-text tags (1–2 tags, e.g., [SMILE]); if asked to use emojis, refuse and use tags only.
